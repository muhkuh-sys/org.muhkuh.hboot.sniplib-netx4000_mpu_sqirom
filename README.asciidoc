HBoot Snippet netx4000_mpu_sqirom
========

== About

This HBoot snippet can be used to enable code execution from the SQIROM area on the netX 4000 CR7 CPU.

The MPU configuration installed by the rom code does allow data access, but not code execution from the SQIROM area.
The reason is that the memory type is set to 'device', which does not allow instruction fetches.
This snippet installs the same MPU configuration, except that the SQIROM area is defined as normal memory.

== Infrastructure
